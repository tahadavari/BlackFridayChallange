# Black Friday Challenge
This repository contains a basic codebase for participants of the Black Friday Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to simulate a Black Friday environment and attempt to optimize the code to achieve a 100% uptime under extremely high load conditions.

Overview
The Black Friday Challenge is designed for developers to test and improve their skills in optimizing web performance. The provided code serves as a starting point. Participants are encouraged to modify and enhance the code to handle high traffic loads efficiently and maintain optimal uptime.


### Load Handling:
Improve how the code handles a large number of simultaneous requests.
Response Time: Minimize the response time for each request.
Resource Management: Efficiently manage resources to prevent downtime.
Scalability: Ensure the application scales well with increasing traffic.
The ultimate goal is to maintain a 100% uptime while handling a load that simulates a Black Friday traffic spike.


# Your code will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

+ Performance: How well does the code perform under heavy load?
+ Stability: Does the code maintain 100% uptime?
+ Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-documented, and maintainable?
+ ...


Enjoy :)
